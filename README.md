# Music LED Project

This project uses [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) to control LEDs that react to music. It is designed to create dynamic lighting effects synchronized with audio input.

## Features

- Real-time LED animations based on music.
- Customizable patterns and effects.

## Requirements

- [PlatformIO Core](https://platformio.org/install)
- Compatible microcontroller (e.g., ESP32, Arduino)
- LED strip (e.g., WS2812B, APA102)
- Audio input module (e.g., microphone or line-in)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2. Open the project in PlatformIO.
3. Install the required libraries (specified in `platformio.ini`).
4. Upload the code to your microcontroller.

## Usage

1. Connect the LED strip and audio input module to your microcontroller.
2. Power the setup and play music.
3. Enjoy the synchronized LED effects!
